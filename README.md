# RobotArm
###Requirements
 * Build a ‘robot’ in SFML with 4 degrees of freedom
  * The range of movement of the arms should be constrained to avoid self intersections.
  * The hand should consist of two ‘fingers’ which can ‘grasp’ an object.
  * Draw 5 balloons (circles). The robot should be able to ‘pop’ the balloons by touching them with the hand.
  * Display a timer, which stops when all balloons are popped.

####Keys

up/down = move upper-arm

a/d = move lower-arm
